Both of these are used for storing code.</p> <p>Let's take a look at <code>web</code>. As you can see, there is just one file. <code>index.html</code>. If you open up a code editor on it, you can see it is just a HTML Hello, World. </p> <p>Now, let's look back a directory, into <code>src</code>. There is only one file here (for now), main.py. If you open this up, you can see that it imports proton (as pt), declares a Window object with 2 arguments, the window name ('A Proton webapp') and the path of the HTML directory (\"web\"). After that, it calls window.start() with one argument, <code>debug = True</code>, which enables inspect element, and a couple neat debugging features. If you run this with <code>python -m proton project run</code>, it opens a Hello, World app, just what you probably expected. </p> <p>You might be thinking: <code>I need to distribute this to someone who doesn't know how to install dependecies, or python itself!</code> No worries, just run <code>python -m proton build --verbose</code> in the project root directory. It does take a while, but once it is done, a compiled executable (main.exe or main.bin on unix-likes) should be in the <code>dist</code> directory. As you can see, once you run main.exe, it works just as it did uncompiled.</p>"},{"location":"PyHTML/basics/","title":"Basics","text":"<p>PyHTML is an implementation to run Python in a Proton app, similar to Brython.
